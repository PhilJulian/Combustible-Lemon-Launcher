###### Lemon Trees

Lemon Trees spawn randomly in newly generated chunks. There's a config option to disable the spawning (requires restart) and they behave just like normal trees: they decay, drop saplings, can be planted and be used by bone meal.<br>
Lemon Trees come with normal leaves and lemon leaves. Lemon Leaves drop the Lemon Item, which is edible. Lemons are registered to the OreDictionary as ``foodLemon``
